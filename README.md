# CES_IA_Ontology
This document contains the MIRO facts (Minimum Information for Reporting of an Ontology) for the ontology ***ensemble.owl*** created as part of the CES IA course at Telecom Evolution.  The ontology tackles the following decision making problem: **choose musical instruments to create an acoustic atmosphere**.  Depending on the ensemble one wants to listen to, on the acoustic climate one wants to create, the ontology helps choose the appropriate set of instruments to be combined.
